To make the program easier to write and to overcome the problem of
intercommunication between different types of machines, higher-level
languages were developed such as BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, Ada, C
and others. A higher-level language is a problem oriented programming
language, whereas a low-level language is machine oriented.
